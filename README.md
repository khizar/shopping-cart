# React Boilerplate
This is the most basic setup where i like to start my projects. 
  
## Stack
* React app with babel for transpilation and babel-polyfill for browser support of latest ECMAScript features
* CSS Modules support and PostCSS for CSS processing.
* Prettier for code formatting
* Jest and Enzyme for testing.
* whatwg-fetch as fetch polyfill
* webpack as the bundler.
