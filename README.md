## Instructions

* Build a simple React+Redux shopping cart.

* Please create a basic Product list page to make interaction with the shopping cart easy. The Product list page will just list some hard coded products. The products need to have a title and a price.

* You need to be able to add items from the product list to the cart. Adding the same item twice will increase the amount in the shopping cart.

* You also need to create a shopping cart view, where you can:

- View all items that have been added to the cart, along with an amount and a total price

- Remove items

- Change item amounts

- Empty the shopping cart alltogether

* Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to assess your code style and familiarity with JavaScript, as well as common tools used in JavaScript development. When solving this exercise, consider ways to make the code clean, maintainable, testable and, where applicable, scalable.
